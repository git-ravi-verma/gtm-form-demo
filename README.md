# gtm-form-demo
This repository contains a simple demo website used to demonstrate Google Tag Manager (GTM) form submission tracking and GA4 event configuration as part of a marketing analytics learning module.  The site is intentionally minimal and built using plain HTML so that learners can focus on tracking concepts, not web development complexity.
